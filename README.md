# Image Video Generator
Creates a video consisting of an image/video and audio. Can produce speech from text if no audio provided. Can produce an image if no image provided. Audio or image or video can come from local file or from YouTube URL. Multiple images can be provided to create a slideshow. If a video asset is referenced, only the video is used from that asset, not the audio. If multiple videos are provided, they are treated as a sequence and looped. If images and videos are provided, .. LOL well good luck and have fun.

  Generate video with text-to-speech, generated image, additional images/videos, and background music:
    python imagevideo.py --audio generate --text "Hello, world!" --image generate,path/to/video1.mp4,https://example.com/image.jpg --bg-music path/to/music.mp3

  Download YouTube audio, use multiple images/videos, and add background music from YouTube:
    python imagevideo.py --audio https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ --image path/to/image1.png,https://example.com/video.mp4 --bg-music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=background_music_id

  Generate video with specific ElevenLabs voice ID:
    python imagevideo.py --audio generate --text "Hello, world!" --voice-id your_voice_id_here

  Run interactively (no arguments):
    python imagevideo.py
```

If you want anything to be automatatically generated, you will need the following environment variables set up on your operating system:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: The API key to use OpenAI services such as GPT (text generation), DALL-E (image generation), and text-to-speech.
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` OR `XI_API_KEY`: The API key provided by ElevenLabs for text-to-speech. You can find it by clicking on your avatar on their web site. 

### Provide audio and image

When asked for audio, provide the full file path to the audio file (.wav, mp3, ...).

When asked for an image, provide the full file path to the image you want to display.

### Provide audio from YouTube URL

When asked for audio, you can provide a YouTube URL to download the audio from.

### Provide audio from text (convert to speech)

When asked for audio, you can just hit ENTER and enter text to be converted to speech. It will generate speech audio and use that as your audio, using the contents of your text as hints for the filename.

### Generating an image

When asked for an image, you can just hit ENTER and enter text to use as hints for an image generator prompt. 

#### Defaulting a generated image

If you hit ENTER again instead of providing image prompt hint text, the image prompt will be automatically generated using the audio hints.

### Defaulting the output file path

When asked for an output file path, you can just hit ENTER and it will generate the output file path based on the audio information and/or filename.
